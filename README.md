# Blockchain Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey learning blockchain development
from first principles, with a focus on **Solidity**, **Ethereum**, and
**Building transparent and inclusive systems**.

The goal is not speed — it’s mastery.

## 🧭 Why This Repository Exists

Blockchain has the potential to reduce corruption, increase transparency,
and give more people access to fair systems — especially in emerging
economies.

This repo is my learning-in-public record: from beginner concepts
to real smart contracts and protocols.
